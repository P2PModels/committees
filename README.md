# Committees

Committees is an Aragon application designed to delegate certain DAO operations on a subgroup of members in order to speed them up. Each committee is created by deploying a token, token manager and voting. The Committee app allows assigning an initial group members, some voting parameters (approve percentage, quorum, etc.), and some token parameters (uniqueness, transferability, etc.).

#### 🐲 Project Stage: Rinkeby

The Committees app has been published to `open.aragonpm.eth` on the Rinkeby test network. If you experience any issues or are interested in contributing please see review our open [issues](https://github.com/p2pmodels/committees/issues).

## How to try Committees immediately

We have a [Committees demo DAO live on Rinkeby!](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/trycommittees/)

### How to run Committees locally

First make sure that you have node, npm, and the Aragon CLI installed and working. Instructions on how to set that up can be found [here](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-intro.html). You'll also need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) or some kind of web wallet enabled to sign transactions in the browser.

Git clone this repo.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/P2PModels/committees.git
```

Navigate into the `committees` directory.

```sh
cd committees
```

Install npm dependencies.

```sh
npm i
```

Deploy a dao with Committees installed on your local environment.

```sh
npm run start:ipfs:template
```

If everything is working correctly, your new DAO will be deployed and your browser will open http://localhost:3000/#/YOUR-DAO-ADDRESS. It should look something like this:

![newly deployed dao with Committees](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/P2PModels/committees/master/app/public/meta/screenshot-1.png)

You will also see the configuration for your local deployment in the terminal. It should look something like this:

```sh
    Ethereum Node: ws://localhost:8545
    ENS registry: 0x5f6f7e8cc7346a11ca2def8f827b7a0b612c56a1
    APM registry: aragonpm.eth
    DAO address: YOUR-DAO-ADDRESS
```

## How to deploy Committees to an organization

Committees has been published to APM on rinkeby at `committees.open.aragonpm.eth`

To deploy to an organization you can use the [Aragon CLI](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-intro.html).

```sh
aragon dao install <dao-address> committees.open.aragonpm.eth --app-init-args <minimetoken-factory> <ens-registry> <initial-manager>
```

| Contract in Network | `<minimetoken-factory>`                      | `<ens-registry>`                             |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Rinkeby             | `0xad991658443c56b3dE2D7d7f5d8C68F339aEef29` | `0x98df287b6c145399aaa709692c8d308357bc085d` |
| Mainnet             | `0xA29EF584c389c67178aE9152aC9C543f9156E2B3` | `0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e` |

The `<initial-manager>` can be set to the DAO's general voting app.

The Committees app must have the `APP_MANAGER_ROLE` permission on `Kernel` and the `CREATE_PERMISSIONS_ROLE` permission on the `ACL`.
